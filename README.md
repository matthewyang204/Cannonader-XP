# Cannonader XP
Recreation of the original Parachute game on iPodOS 1.4. Uses Windows XP background. After unzipping the app and dragging it to the Applications folder, you need to run the following command to verify the app that it is not damaged, or else your Mac will say that the app is damaged.
```
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Cannonader\ XP.app
```
